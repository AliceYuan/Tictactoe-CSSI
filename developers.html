											Alice Yuan comes from Mississauga Canada and will be going to Waterloo University majoring in Software Engineering this fall. 
											She currently goes to an arts school and loves all things art and technology related. Alice was the unofficial project 
											manager of TicTacToe hiring two grunts and saving them from utter failure in their lives. She took it as her 
											responsibility to take in two lost, but handsome, young men and raise them as if she were a mother wolf nurturing her cubs.

										Matt watches way too many movies for his own good. To describe Matt would be to try and describe the 
										cross between Gandhi and Jim Carrey with enough sizzle to spark memories of a time when things were much
										simpler much like the scenes from Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life".
