          <p> Original TicTacToe is nothing less than a well composed, visually stunning, instance of the classic game we all know and love. Play for hours on end against a buddy on the same computer or take the artificial intelligence of your computer on with a VS computer option. Regardless of your preference, be prepared to have more fun than your puny human body can handle! </p>

          <p> Cr@Zy TicTacToe is a completely different style of the old classic tic tac toe. Cr@Zy TicTacToe is one large tic tac toe board with nine smaller tic tac toe boards inside the larger one. However, Cr@Zy TicTacToe is not merely nine classic tic tac toe games within one as it redefines the gameplay of traditional tic tac toe. The way gameplay works is between two players on the same computer. The move of the previous player determines where the next player moves. How does this work out you ask? Simple. The first player moves in any one of the smaller boards. The cell associated with the smaller board is then the designated cell that the next player will move to relative to the large board. In order to win a player must occupy 3 cells in order, either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, on the large board, by winning a small board in the classic manner. Inception much? On top of that, if a player has won a smaller board, as long as it has free cells, one can still play and send the other player to a board that has already been won. This reinvention of tic tac toe takes the classic game and redefines the strategy and the fun to a new level of 'Cr@Zy' for nonstop fun all day.   </p>
